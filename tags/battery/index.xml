      <description>After upgrading my iPhone 3G to OS 3.0, I was really exited to start playing with all of the new features. Some of my favorites include spotlight, cut/copy/paste and push notifications.
Unfortunately, immediately after installing the update, my battery life was terrible at best. I use my iPhone for work and receive over a hundred emails per day through our exchange server. Before the 3.0 upgrade, I could easily get through a day on 1 charge.</description>

      <description>Apple products have not been kind to me over the past couple of months.
For starters, about 2 months ago, the plastic on my iPhone&amp;rsquo;s back cracked right at the mute switch. This is a common problem that has been documented all over the internet (link1, link2). Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of mine: Soon after this happened, I purchased a second battery from the Apple store. Good thing I did, because the very next day, my original battery wouldn&amp;rsquo;t charge.</description>
