      <description>Recently, I upgraded my iPhone from a 3G to a 3GS and was planning on selling the 3G on Ebay. After listing it then going through the bidding process, a user named &amp;ldquo;charlesgaulle&amp;rdquo; had won. Immediately after the auction ended I noticed that this person was from France and my auction explicitly stated that this was to only be sold to someone living in the UK. Also, the person&amp;rsquo;s name (Branson Jean) doesn&amp;rsquo;t even match the username, which is when I started getting suspicious.</description>
