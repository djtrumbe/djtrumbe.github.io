      <description>After upgrading my iPhone 3G to OS 3.0, I was really exited to start playing with all of the new features. Some of my favorites include spotlight, cut/copy/paste and push notifications.
Unfortunately, immediately after installing the update, my battery life was terrible at best. I use my iPhone for work and receive over a hundred emails per day through our exchange server. Before the 3.0 upgrade, I could easily get through a day on 1 charge.</description>
