      <description>In trying to migrate from Firefox to Safari on all of my Macs, one thing that has bothered me is the inability to do 1-window browsing (i.e. opening all links in new tabs instead of new windows). After scouring the interwebs, I am still unable to accomplish this in Safari v4.0.4 and Mac OS v10.6.2. Even though there are multiple blog posts out there explaining a simple solution, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work on any of my machines.</description>

      <description>Such an annoying problem, especially for connecting to GMail via IMAP. I constantly get the error: Too many simultaneous connections. The worst part is this has been known ever since Leopard shipped:
 http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=5820548 http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1207290&amp;amp;tstart=30  Any fix, Apple?
UPDATE
This problem seems to date much further back then Leopard. I&amp;rsquo;ve found references to this same issue in late 2003 (v10.3!!), here:
 http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031130150826388  Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to server configuration as my problem is with GMail.</description>

      <description>After upgrading my iPhone 3G to OS 3.0, I was really exited to start playing with all of the new features. Some of my favorites include spotlight, cut/copy/paste and push notifications.
Unfortunately, immediately after installing the update, my battery life was terrible at best. I use my iPhone for work and receive over a hundred emails per day through our exchange server. Before the 3.0 upgrade, I could easily get through a day on 1 charge.</description>

      <description>Apple products have not been kind to me over the past couple of months.
For starters, about 2 months ago, the plastic on my iPhone&amp;rsquo;s back cracked right at the mute switch. This is a common problem that has been documented all over the internet (link1, link2). Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of mine: Soon after this happened, I purchased a second battery from the Apple store. Good thing I did, because the very next day, my original battery wouldn&amp;rsquo;t charge.</description>
