      <description>I know that much has been made of data and connectivity problems on AT&amp;amp;T in the States, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found O2 to be just as bad, if not worse. About once per day, even though I have full bars and am connected to 3G, my iPhone is unable to receive any data. Loading webpages doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, refreshing mail doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, connecting to the App Store doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, etc. This occurs for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time and can sometimes occur multiple times per day.</description>
