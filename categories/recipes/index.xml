      <description>One of our favorite foods is hummus. After returning from Israel I was on a mission to find the best hummus recipe. The only tool you need to make hummus is either a food processor or hand blender. You could use a normal blender for this, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend it.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my work in progress:
 1 can of chick peas 2 to 3 tbsp liquid from drained chick peas Juice from 1 lemon 1&amp;frasl;3 cup tahini 1 to 2 cloves garlic (or 1 to 2 tsp garlic powder) 1&amp;frasl;2 to 1 tsp salt 2 tbsp olive oil (optional)  Put all ingredients except for the olive oil and tahini in the bowl and blend until fine.</description>

      <description>Below is the recipe for a Cornish pasty from Grandma Trumbell that my Mom has been making for years. Because I now live in London and this recipe was created in the US, the recipe is still in the works for all you UK residents.
Crust:
 1 cup of plain flour 1&amp;frasl;3 cup of Trex (or 1&amp;frasl;3 cup of Crisco) 1&amp;frasl;3 tsp of table salt 1&amp;frasl;4 cup of ice cold water  Mix flour, shortening and salt, then add water gradually until dough holds together.</description>
