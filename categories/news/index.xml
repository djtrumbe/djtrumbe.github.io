      <title>Drobo: Thin Provisioning</title>

      <description>If you know me, you know that I&amp;rsquo;m a huge proponent of Drobo. As of late, the frustration level with Drobo is increasing and it may have edged away at this enthusiasm.
My most recent frustration came when I upgraded a drive in my Drobo to increase the usable space to more then 2TB. After the Drobo finished updating all of its partitions, I was left with a partition that was labeled &amp;lsquo;unallocated&amp;rsquo; in the Drobo dashboard.</description>

      <title>No way to limit IMAP SSL connections in Apple Mail</title>

      <description>Such an annoying problem, especially for connecting to GMail via IMAP. I constantly get the error: Too many simultaneous connections. The worst part is this has been known ever since Leopard shipped:
 https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5820548 https://discussions.apple.com/thread/1207290  Any fix, Apple?
UPDATE This problem seems to date much further back then Leopard. I&amp;rsquo;ve found references to this same issue in late 2003 (v10.3!!), here:
 https://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20031130150826388  Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to server configuration as my problem is with GMail.</description>

      <title>Fraud on Ebay</title>

      <description>Recently, I upgraded my iPhone from a 3G to a 3GS and was planning on selling the 3G on Ebay. After listing it then going through the bidding process, a user named &amp;ldquo;charlesgaulle&amp;rdquo; had won. Immediately after the auction ended I noticed that this person was from France and my auction explicitly stated that this was to only be sold to someone living in the UK. Also, the person&amp;rsquo;s name (Branson Jean) doesn&amp;rsquo;t even match the username, which is when I started getting suspicious.</description>

      <title>O2 Data Frequently Drops</title>
      <link>https://djtrumbe.github.io/2009/09/15/o2-data-frequently-drops/</link>

      <description>I know that much has been made of data and connectivity problems on AT&amp;amp;T in the States, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found O2 to be just as bad, if not worse. About once per day, even though I have full bars and am connected to 3G, my iPhone is unable to receive any data. Loading webpages doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, refreshing mail doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, connecting to the App Store doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, etc. This occurs for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time and can sometimes occur multiple times per day.</description>

      <description>Do you have a specific set of webpages that you browse to every day? I do. I used to have all of these sites bookmarked and placed into specific news folders in Firefox or Safari. Right-clicking on a folder would present the option to &amp;lsquo;Open All in Tabs&amp;rsquo; and all of my favorites would be right there for me to filter through. This was easy to setup and I had all of my regular pages a couple of clicks away.</description>

      <title>WordPress Security Threat</title>
      <link>https://djtrumbe.github.io/2009/09/06/wordpress-security-threat/</link>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been posted all over the internet as of late, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to remind everyone of the security threat to WordPress blogs:
WordPress 2.8.4: Security Release
How to Keep WordPress Secure
From the above links, the way to keep yourself safe from this attack is by upgrading. Make sure you back your DB beforehand. The easiest way to backup your DB is via this plugin:
wp-db-backup
The sooner you upgrade, the sooner you are safe from this exploit.</description>

      <title>Apple Hardware Problems</title>

      <description>Apple products have not been kind to me over the past couple of months.
For starters, about 2 months ago, the plastic on my iPhone&amp;rsquo;s back cracked right at the mute switch. This is a common problem that has been documented all over the internet ( link1, link2 ). Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of mine: Soon after this happened, I purchased a second battery from the Apple store. Good thing I did, because the very next day, my original battery wouldn&amp;rsquo;t charge.</description>
