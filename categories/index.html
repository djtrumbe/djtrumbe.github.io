    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In trying to migrate from Firefox to Safari on all of my Macs, one thing that has bothered me is the inability to do 1-window browsing (i.e. opening all links in new tabs instead of new windows). After scouring the interwebs, I am still unable to accomplish this in Safari v4.0.4 and Mac OS v10.6.2. Even though there are multiple blog posts out there explaining a simple solution, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to work on any of my machines.

Unfortunately, immediately after installing the update, my battery life was terrible at best. I use my iPhone for work and receive over a hundred emails per day through our exchange server. Before the 3.0 upgrade, I could easily get through a day on 1 charge.

      If you know me, you know that I&#8217;m a huge proponent of Drobo. As of late, the frustration level with Drobo is increasing and it may have edged away at this enthusiasm.
My most recent frustration came when I upgraded a drive in my Drobo to increase the usable space to more then 2TB. After the Drobo finished updating all of its partitions, I was left with a partition that was labeled &#8216;unallocated&#8217; in the Drobo dashboard.

      Recently, I upgraded my iPhone from a 3G to a 3GS and was planning on selling the 3G on Ebay. After listing it then going through the bidding process, a user named &ldquo;charlesgaulle&rdquo; had won. Immediately after the auction ended I noticed that this person was from France and my auction explicitly stated that this was to only be sold to someone living in the UK. Also, the person&rsquo;s name (Branson Jean) doesn&rsquo;t even match the username, which is when I started getting suspicious.

      I know that much has been made of data and connectivity problems on AT&amp;T in the States, but I&rsquo;ve found O2 to be just as bad, if not worse. About once per day, even though I have full bars and am connected to 3G, my iPhone is unable to receive any data. Loading webpages doesn&rsquo;t work, refreshing mail doesn&rsquo;t work, connecting to the App Store doesn&rsquo;t work, etc. This occurs for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time and can sometimes occur multiple times per day.

I do. I used to have all of these sites bookmarked and placed into specific news folders in Firefox or Safari. Right-clicking on a folder would present the option to &lsquo;Open All in Tabs&rsquo; and all of my favorites would be right there for me to filter through. This was easy to setup and I had all of my regular pages a couple of clicks away.

      One of our favorite foods is hummus. After returning from Israel I was on a mission to find the best hummus recipe. The only tool you need to make hummus is either a food processor or hand blender. You could use a normal blender for this, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.
Here&rsquo;s my work in progress:
 1 can of chick peas 2 to 3 tbsp liquid from drained chick peas Juice from 1 lemon 1&frasl;3 cup tahini 1 to 2 cloves garlic (or 1 to 2 tsp garlic powder) 1&frasl;2 to 1 tsp salt 2 tbsp olive oil (optional)  Put all ingredients except for the olive oil and tahini in the bowl and blend until fine.

      If you know me, you know that I&#8217;m a huge proponent of Drobo. As of late, the frustration level with Drobo is increasing and it may have edged away at this enthusiasm.
My most recent frustration came when I upgraded a drive in my Drobo to increase the usable space to more then 2TB. After the Drobo finished updating all of its partitions, I was left with a partition that was labeled &#8216;unallocated&#8217; in the Drobo dashboard.

        Safari: Open all links in new tabs

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In trying to migrate from Firefox to Safari on all of my Macs, one thing that has bothered me is the inability to do 1-window browsing (i.e. opening all links in new tabs instead of new windows). After scouring the interwebs, I am still unable to accomplish this in Safari v4.0.4 and Mac OS v10.6.2. Even though there are multiple blog posts out there explaining a simple solution, it doesn&rsquo;t seem to work on any of my machines.

        XBox Live NAT problems on BE

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      For quite a while I&rsquo;ve struggled with a &lsquo;strict&rsquo; NAT when connecting to XBox Live. I&rsquo;ve finally fixed this problem. Apparently, BE locks down their Speedtouch routers which creates this problem. The fix is simple:

On top of this, you may need to forward some ports on your router:

When I get some time, I will try to confirm the need for mapping ports.

        O2 Data Frequently Drops

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I know that much has been made of data and connectivity problems on AT&amp;T in the States, but I&rsquo;ve found O2 to be just as bad, if not worse. About once per day, even though I have full bars and am connected to 3G, my iPhone is unable to receive any data. Loading webpages doesn&rsquo;t work, refreshing mail doesn&rsquo;t work, connecting to the App Store doesn&rsquo;t work, etc. This occurs for about 5 to 10 minutes at a time and can sometimes occur multiple times per day.

        Fraud on Ebay

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Recently, I upgraded my iPhone from a 3G to a 3GS and was planning on selling the 3G on Ebay. After listing it then going through the bidding process, a user named &ldquo;charlesgaulle&rdquo; had won. Immediately after the auction ended I noticed that this person was from France and my auction explicitly stated that this was to only be sold to someone living in the UK. Also, the person&rsquo;s name (Branson Jean) doesn&rsquo;t even match the username, which is when I started getting suspicious.
