      <description>If you know me, you know that I’m a huge proponent of Drobo. As of late, the frustration level with Drobo is increasing and it may have edged away at this enthusiasm.
My most recent frustration came when I upgraded a drive in my Drobo to increase the usable space to more then 2TB. After the Drobo finished updating all of its partitions, I was left with a partition that was labeled ‘unallocated’ in the Drobo dashboard.</description>

      <description>In trying to migrate from Firefox to Safari on all of my Macs, one thing that has bothered me is the inability to do 1-window browsing (i.e. opening all links in new tabs instead of new windows). After scouring the interwebs, I am still unable to accomplish this in Safari v4.0.4 and Mac OS v10.6.2. Even though there are multipleblogpostsout there explaining a simple solution, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work on any of my machines.</description>

      <title>Fraud on Ebay</title>

      <description>Recently, I upgraded my iPhone from a 3G to a 3GS and was planning on selling the 3G on Ebay. After listing it then going through the bidding process, a user named &amp;ldquo;charlesgaulle&amp;rdquo; had won. Immediately after the auction ended I noticed that this person was from France and my auction explicitly stated that this was to only be sold to someone living in the UK. Also, the person&amp;rsquo;s name (Branson Jean) doesn&amp;rsquo;t even match the username, which is when I started getting suspicious.</description>
